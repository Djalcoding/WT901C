# WT901C
This is an unoffical arduino library for the ESP-32 (support for other micro-controllers will be added in the future) that aims to simplify the use of WIT-motion's [WT901C 9-axis Digital Inclinometer Accelerometer](https://www.wit-motion.com/proztsz/43.html)

## Installation
1. Get the .zip file from the releases section
2. Open arduino IDE, any version is ok
3. Go to Sketch, Include Library, Add .ZIP library
4. Choose the .zip file you just installed
5. You now have the library installed

  ### Note 
  I will eventually do a wiki section.

## What is currently supported ?
- Acceleration
- Rotation
- Angular velocity
- Magnetic field reading
- Temperature

## What next ? 
- [] Calibration
